Great question—an ordering will help you build intuition layer by layer while also leaving room for detours as your interests evolve. Below is a **reading roadmap** that integrates both _physics_ and _mathematics_ texts into a coherent progression, assuming you want to read during your Ph.D. for both background mastery and long-term depth.

I’ve broken the books into **phases** (Foundations → Formalism → Specialization → Horizons). Tensor notation and rigorous proofs are prioritized throughout.

### 📘 Physics
- **Jose & Saletan – Classical Dynamics**
- **Landau & Lifshitz Vol. 2 – Classical Field Theory**
- **Wald – General Relativity**

- **Riehl – Category Theory in Context**
→ _Optional: start working through papers on quantum foundations + entropy (Caticha, Zurek, Goold)_

---
## 📚 PHASE 4: Specialization and Intellectual Horizons

> ✅ Purpose: Explore speculative and cutting-edge areas aligned with your curiosity (entropy, quantum information, category-theoretic foundations, thermodynamics of quantum systems).

### 📘 Physics / Interdisciplinary
- **Isham – Lectures on Quantum Theory**
- **Nakahara – Geometry, Topology, and Physics**
- **Wilde – Quantum Information Theory**
- **Davies & Gregersen – Information and the Nature of Reality**
- **Georgi – Lie Algebras in Particle Physics**
- **Zurek, Caticha, Goold, et al. papers**
→ _Use blog or writing platform to publish your own interpretations, derivations, and reformulations_

## 💡 Tips on Execution
- Take notes by section, not just by chapter—capture key theorems, derivations, and interconnections.
- Consider alternating: 1 math → 1 physics → 1 application.
- Maintain a “foundational review” habit: reread earlier books once per year to deepen understanding.
- When you hit fatigue or burnout: switch to related philosophy of science texts or broad overviews (like Sean Carroll’s "The Big Picture").
