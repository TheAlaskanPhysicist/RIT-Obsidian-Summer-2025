### Quantities
We assume no changing of basis vectors (for undergraduate)
$$\begin{align}
\vec{r}&=r^ie_i && \text{(Position)}\\
\vec{v}&=\dfrac{dr^i}{dt}e_i && \text{(Velocity)}\\
\vec{a}&=\dfrac{d^2r^i}{dt^2}e_i && \text{(Accleration)}\\
\vec{p}&=m\vec{v} && \text{(Momentum)}\\
\vec{F}&=m\vec{a} && \text{(Force)}\\
\vec{l}&=\vec{r}\times\vec{p} && \text{(Angular Momentum)}\\
\vec{\tau}&=\vec{r}\times\vec{F} && \text{(Torque)}\\
T&=\dfrac{1}{2}m\vec{v}^2 && \text{(Kinetic Energy)}\\
\end{align}$$

### Newton's First Law
In the absence of forces, a point particle moves with constant velocity $\vec{v}$.
> This only applies in Inertial Reference Frames
### Newton's Second Law
For any point particle of mass $m$, the net force $\vec{F}$ on the particle is always equal to the mass time acceleration of the particle's acceleration.
> This only applies in Inertial Reference Frames
### Newton's Third Law
The generation of forces must always come in pairs of equal and opposite value.
> This leads directly to the conservation of momentum.


No external forces $\implies$ Conserved momentum (over time).

Forces are "real," Potentials are not.
This is similar to $\vec{E}$ and $\vec{B}$ being "real," but $\phi$ and $\vec{A}$ are not.


Moments of mass:
$$\begin{align}
M\vec{R}&=\int \vec{r}\ dm && \text{(Center of Mass)}\\

\end{align}$$

Linear Momentum is conserved (in inertial frames)
Angular Momentum is conserved (in inertial frames)
Is there a true total momentum conserved (in inertial frames)?

Path Independence <-> Conserved
There will a unique "potential" for it if it's conserved.

$$\begin{align}
\vec{F}&=-\vec\nabla U
\end{align}$$
Central forces = Spherically-symmetric forces


For non-conservative systems: Use sums of forces in a differential equation.
For conservative systems: Use Euler-Lagrange equations.
