A massless spring of strength $k$ is anchored at the shared point $r=0$, with a box of mass $m$ attached rigidly to non-anchored point of the spring. The equilibrium length of the spring is $L_0$.
The experiment is done on a frictionless table (no gravity forces).

There are 2 observers who witness the physics.
 - Frame A, an external witness, who sees the mass moving with an angular velocity $\omega$.
 - Frame B, a witness at-rest angularly, who is co-rotating with the mass.

a) In Frame A's perspective, what do they measure to be the length of the spring?
$$\begin{align}
\vec{F}_c&=-m\dfrac{v^2}{r}\hat{r}=-mr\omega^2\hat{r}\\
F_s&=-k|r-L_0|\hat{r}
\end{align}$$
Setting the forces equal, we see that:
$$\begin{align}
k(r-L_0)&=-mr\omega^2\\
\Aboxed{L_A&=\dfrac{k}{k+m\omega^2}L_0}
\end{align}$$

b) In Frame B's perspective, what do they *believe* to be the length of the spring?
$$\begin{align}
\Aboxed{L_B&=L_0}
\end{align}$$
c) Why would Frame B conclude their length is at equilibrium? (hint: the question does not specify who's equilibrium it is)

d) In Frame B's perspective, what do they *measure* to be the length of the spring?
$$\begin{align}
k(r-L_0)&=-mr\omega^2\\
\Aboxed{L_B&=\dfrac{k}{k+m\omega^2}L_0}
\end{align}$$
