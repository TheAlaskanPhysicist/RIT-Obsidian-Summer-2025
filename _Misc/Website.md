### Design tips for a physics site:
- Clean, minimalist design with readable fonts
- Use LaTeX or MathJax for inline math rendering
- Highlight important equations or concepts
- Provide downloadable PDFs of papers/slides
- Responsive layout for mobile access



### Design goals for a physicist site:
- **Clean, minimal, professional, readable**
- Good math support (rendering inline and block formulas)
- Easy navigation
- Responsive (works on phone and desktop)
- Subtle academic vibe (not flashy, but not boring either)
- Support for images, figures, and code snippets


### Colors / fonts:
- Use serif fonts for body text (e.g., Palatino, Georgia) for readability
- Sans-serif for headers or UI (e.g., Helvetica, Arial)
- Keep colors subtle — dark text on light background or dark mode if you like
- MathJax renders math nicely in the style of the page
