### My Philosophy of Physics
Everything in this universe can be modeled with a certain number of parameters and an "equation of state." Too little parameters and the system fails to capture all the detail. Too many parameters and the system is overfit to the data. Every parameter represents an amount of "information" it models the system with, and that there are an infinite number of "correct" parameters, but that they will always have a global minimum of information that still maintains full description of the system.

## Habits of a Physicist
Revisiting assumptions of models and how that leads to their behavior.

Monthly Research Review:
 - What did I read
 - What problems I attempted
 - Questions/Insight gathered
 - Goals for next month

A list called "Questions No Textbook Has Answered For Me (Yet)"

Present at Local Seminars Regularly.
 - Even internal lab group meetings, journal clubs, or reading groups count. Practicing exposition makes your thinking clearer and earns you feedback early.

Meet at Least One New Researcher per Semester
 - Reach out after a seminar
 - Cold-email if their work intersects with yours
 - Ask intelligent questions

ALWAYS ATTEND:
 - APS (March or April)
 - Gordon Conferences
 - ICHEP, Strings, QIP
 - Smaller/Local conferences

Organize a Reading Group
 - Even 2–3 people reading QFT or statistical mechanics weekly can have a big impact on long-term mastery. Bonus if you rotate who presents.

Find a Role Model
- Someone a decade ahead of you in a field you might like.
- Read their early papers. Email them with thoughtful questions.
- Track how their ideas evolved.

|Area|Habit/Activity|
|---|---|
|Communication|Present regularly, run a reading group|
|Networking|Attend conferences, email researchers|
|Self-Mastery|Monthly research review, deep questions list|
|Writing|Knowledge archive, blog annotated papers|
|Teaching|Try YouTube/Twitch (optional but valuable)|
|Reading Strategy|Choose depth over speed|
|Reflection|Regular metacognitive journaling|
|Mentorship|Identify & learn from role models|


## Programming
Relearn Git commandline
Relearn C/C++ and add in CUDA
Learn Mathematica
Look into SymPy, SciPy, Julia, etc.
Start to read German and French (Russian Too)




Physics Journal - log what I learned and ideas I come up with.
Reproduce one major paper every few months.

**Deep-dive into your subfield.** Choose a few key papers and master them—not just read, but **reproduce results** and annotate every line.

Start a **research logbook** (physical or digital) with dated entries for every idea, derivation, or result—make it a habit.

Ask your advisor weekly or biweekly: 
"What are the three most important papers I should read this month?"
